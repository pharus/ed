ed

My own clone of [ed unix
command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%28text_editor%29)

I find ed a really interesting piece of software, mainly for being so pedagogic
in nature. Its workflow is based as in a shell, and then its functionality
extends in a really scalable manner.

I'll be doing here what I've told some dozen of my students to do, build myself
a clone of ed.


Careful considerations, on the development, a Roadmap some would call:
- [ ] Build a small shell
- [ ] Incrementally add functions
- [ ] Add support for custom command line arguments
- [ ] Pimp it up, in rude words "Just make it pretty"

According to this roadmap, I normally start by the first item , and jump
between the last 3 concurrently, being that all of them are inter dependent.

Status:
- Still designing basic parts
